# Laravel CRM App Plan

I want to create a **slim CRM application** using **Laravel** that will run locally on my Mac with **MAMP Pro** and **MYSQL**. Please follow **Laravel best practices** (from the official docs and community conventions). Keep the initial build structured for growth.

-   Always look for existing code to iterate on before creating new code.
